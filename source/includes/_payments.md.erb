## Payments

Payments in Quaderno-lingo represent the recording of a successful payment.

Like [items](#items), payments are a sub-object and can be attached to multiple types of other records:

- Invoices and sales receipts
- Expenses

<aside class="notice">
Note that unlike items, payments cannot exist in Quaderno separately to an instance of one of these classes, and the same payment cannot be referenced by more than one instance.

### Create a payment

> `POST /invoices/INVOICE_ID/payments.json` or `POST /expenses/EXPENSE_ID/payments.json`

```shell
# body.json
{
  "amount":"56.60",
  "payment_method":"credit_card",
  "payment_processor":"stripe",
  "payment_processor_id":"ch_19yUdh2eZvKYlo2CkFVBOZG7"
}

# curl command
curl -u YOUR_API_KEY:x \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -X POST \
     --data-binary @body.json \
     'https://ACCOUNT_NAME.quadernoapp.com/api/invoices/INVOICE_ID/payments.json'
```

```php
$payment = new QuadernoPayment(array(
                                'date' => date('2012-10-10'),
                                'payment_method' => 'credit_card',
                                'amount' => '56.60',
                                'payment_processor' => 'stripe',
                                'payment_processor_id' => 'ch_19yUdh2eZvKYlo2CkFVBOZG7'));

$invoice->addPayment($payment);               // Return true (success) or false (error)
$invoice->save();                             // Returns true (success) or false (error)
```

```ruby
invoice = Quaderno::Invoice.find(invoice_id)
params = {
    payment_method: 'credit_card',
    amount: '56.60',
    payment_processor: 'stripe',
    payment_processor_id: 'ch_19yUdh2eZvKYlo2CkFVBOZG7'
}
invoice.add_payment(params) #=> Quaderno::Payment
```

`POST`ing to `invoices/INVOICE_ID/payments.json` or `expenses/EXPENSE_ID/payments.json` will create a new payment from the parameters passed. Note that payments can only be created as an attachment to an invoice or expense.

This will return `201 Created` and the current JSON representation of the payment if the creation was a success, along with the location of the new item in the `Location` header.
