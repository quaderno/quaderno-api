## Tax jurisdictions

A tax jurisdiction is an area subject to its own tax regulations. A tax jurisdiction can be a country, region, group of countries, province, state, city, county, district or any other area with a designated authority for tax purposes.

A businesses cannot collect taxes in a particular jurisdiction without being registered for tax collection with their tax authorities first.
